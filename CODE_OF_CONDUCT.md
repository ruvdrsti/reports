# Resources Code of Conduct

This Code of Conduct is in addition to the [GQCG Code of Conduct](https://github.com/GQCG/gqcg/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and contains additional provisions for those working on teaching resources.

All resources should be considered classified and should not be shared with people that are not members of the repository in questions. Only the members of GQCG can divulge additional information concerning the content of this repository when they deem it necessary to do so. Under no circumstances non-members, in whatever capacity, divulge any such information. These provisions remain valid after members are no longer part of these repositories. Violations of these provisions are subject to severe sanctions.

Any suspected breach of security (loss of laptop or suspected unauthorized access) should be reported as soon as possible to patrick.bultinck@ugent.be or guillaume.acke@ugent.be.
